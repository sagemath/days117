    "# Abelian Sandpile Model\n",
    "\n",
    "David Perkinson, Reed College\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "These notes provide an introduction to Dhar's abelian sandpile model\n",
    "(ASM) and to Sage Sandpiles, a collection of tools in Sage for doing\n",
    "sandpile calculations. For a more thorough introduction to the theory of\n",
    "the ASM, the papers *Chip-Firing and Rotor-Routing on Directed Graphs*\n",
    "<a href=\"#H\" class=\"citation\">[H]</a> by Holroyd et al., and\n",
    "*Riemann-Roch and Abel-Jacobi Theory on a Finite Graph* by Baker and\n",
    "Norine <a href=\"#BN\" class=\"citation\">[BN]</a> are recommended. See also\n",
    "<a href=\"#PPW2013\" class=\"citation\">[PPW2013]</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the ASM, we start with a *sandpile graph*: a directed\n",
    "multigraph $\\Gamma$ with a vertex $s$ that is accessible from every\n",
    "vertex. By *multigraph*, we mean that each edge of $\\Gamma$ is assigned\n",
    "a nonnegative integer weight. To say $s$ is *accessible* from some\n",
    "vertex $v$ means that there is a sequence (possibly empty) of directed\n",
    "edges starting at $v$ and ending at $s$. We call $s$ the *sink* of the\n",
    "sandpile graph, even though it might have outgoing edges, for reasons\n",
    "that will be made clear in a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote the vertex set of $\\Gamma$ by $V$, and define\n",
    "$\\tilde{V} = V\\setminus\\{s\\}$. For any vertex $v$, we let\n",
    "$\\mbox{out-degree}(v)$ (the *out-degree* of $v$) be the sum of the\n",
    "weights of all edges leaving $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configurations and divisors\n",
    "\n",
    "A *configuration* on $\\Gamma$ is an element of $\\ZZ_{\\geq 0} \\tilde{V}$,\n",
    "i.e., the assignment of a nonnegative integer to each nonsink vertex. We\n",
    "think of each integer as a number of grains of sand being placed at the\n",
    "corresponding vertex. A *divisor* on $\\Gamma$ is an element of $\\ZZ V$,\n",
    "i.e., an element in the free abelian group on *all* of the vertices. In\n",
    "the context of divisors, it is sometimes useful to think of a divisor on\n",
    "$\\Gamma$ as assigning dollars to each vertex, with negative integers\n",
    "signifying a debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stabilization\n",
    "\n",
    "A configuration $c$ is *stable* at a vertex $v\\in\\tilde{V}$ if\n",
    "$c(v) < \\mbox{out-degree}(v)$. Otherwise, $c$ is *unstable* at $v$. A\n",
    "configuration $c$ (in itself) is *stable* if it is stable at each\n",
    "nonsink vertex. Otherwise, $c$ is *unstable*. If $c$ is unstable at $v$,\n",
    "the vertex $v$ can be *fired* (*toppled*) by removing\n",
    "$\\mbox{out-degree}(v)$ grains of sand from $v$ and adding grains of sand\n",
    "to the neighbors of $v$, determined by the weights of the edges leaving\n",
    "$v$ (each vertex $w$ gets as many grains as the weight of the edge\n",
    "$(v, w)$ is, if there is such an edge). Note that grains that are added\n",
    "to the sink $s$ are not counted (i.e., they \"disappear\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite our best intentions, we sometimes consider firing a stable\n",
    "vertex, resulting in a \"configuration\" with a negative amount of sand at\n",
    "that vertex. We may also *reverse-fire* a vertex, absorbing sand from\n",
    "the vertex's neighbors (including the sink).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example.** Consider the graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "<img src=\"media/sandpile/example1.png\" class=\"align-center\" alt=\"\" /><figcaption><span class=\"math inline\"><em>Γ</em></span></figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "All edges have weight $1$ except for the edge from vertex 1 to vertex 3,\n",
    "which has weight $2$. If we let $c = (5,0,1)$ with the indicated number\n",
    "of grains of sand on vertices 1, 2, and 3, respectively, then only\n",
    "vertex 1, whose out-degree is 4, is unstable. Firing vertex 1 gives a\n",
    "new configuration $c' = (1,1,3)$. Here, $4$ grains have left vertex 1.\n",
    "One of these has gone to the sink vertex (and forgotten), one has gone\n",
    "to vertex 2, and two have gone to vertex 3, since the edge from 1 to 3\n",
    "has weight $2$. Vertex 3 in the new configuration is now unstable. The\n",
